# Requirements

The object detector is capturing the window of the game in LINUX env, therefore changement need to be done with pygetwindow in windows

# Progress step

- Build flappy bird game in python :white_check_mark:
- Generate dataset by playing the game :white_check_mark:
- Train yolo :white_check_mark:
- Window capture by external program and object detector :white_check_mark:
- Tracker and paralelize the detection to optimize real-time app
- Build InApp RL model
- Use this architecture in external app combine with computer vision

# Results

Here's computer eyes with simple detector.
